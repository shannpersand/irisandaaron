  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>Iris and Aaron had met in 2013 online. They were instantly in love and enjoyed sharing many of their similar interests like surfing, hiking, eating, and especially traveling.</p>
  <p>He knew early on that she was the one when he noticed she didn't mind walking barefoot from the parking spot to go surfing. She got bonus points for carrying her board herself even after being offered to share the load.</p>
  <p>She knew he was the one when he spent an entire day helping her bake Christmas cookies for all of her 60 of her coworkers.</p>

  <h2>The Proposal</h2>
  <p>Aaron had one day asked Iris to not plan anything for a Saturday morning as some friends from work were planning to go to an early breakfast at a new spot in Kapolei. They had plans to leave for breakfast at around 6am since it might be a busy spot and they wanted to get their early to accommodate the group size.</p>
  <p>Aaron then pulled into the inter-island parking and announces they're going on a weekend trip. Aaron had already packed a few things for a surprise weekend getaway and pulled out boarding passes to Kona. Iris was incredibly confused as the coffee had not reached her brain but went along with the plan anyway. Iris had absolutely no clue this was "The Trip". 
  </p>
  <p>They arrived in Kona, got their rental car and headed to the hotel to check in. As they were driving Iris asked Aaron if they could go up to Mauna Kea to watch the sunset if they had no plans later.  To which Aaron nonchalantly replied "Sure, I guess we can fit that in." Iris had no idea he had already packed jackets, jeans, and gloves in the bag. Later that day they drove up to the summit of Mauna Kea to try and catch the sunset. 
  </p>
  <p>The sun was setting quickly and it took a little longer to get there than Aaron expected. After finding a parking spot looking out to the deep orange setting sun, he raced to set up the camera for a couple of pictures before it became dark.  Aaron led Iris to stand in the perfect spot and got down on one knee.  He performed the perfect proposal at sunset on the tallest mountain in the world. </p>
  <h3>And they'll be married soon to live happily ever after.</h3>
